# Victor's portfolio
Hello,
I'm a mining engineer using programming to improve my work methods. I tend to automate boring/dull tasks to focus my work on engineering and not data entry/manipulation. My portfolio consists of both work and personnal projects in various programming languages.

VBA is my go-to language for work projects because I often create tools that must be easily accessible through Excel. I find it a sufficient tool for quick data entry by technicians and other users. I've used SQL database with Excel and prefer this solution, especially for large databases.

I am currently taking some Computer Science courses, being offered in C++ and Python.


## Projects
### Stability Graph Method (VBA)
The Stability Graph Method intends to compile stope performance using rock mass characterization, dimensions and induced stresses. The intent of the tool is to estimate the stope performance and identify underlying failure mechanisms.

An Excel file is used store and process the data. The VBA code sample is a compilation of all the custom functions used to provide all outputs required for the Mathews-Potvin method. One of the specifics of this project was to eliminate the use of macros in favor of functions as they are seamless in their use for the typical user.

#### Upcoming improvements
Create basic lines of 80% probability of a given ELOS from the current data.

### Kerbal Space Program Automatic Landing (Python)
I must admit I have an interest in the physics of spacecrafts. One of the cheaper ways to play with is Kerbal Space Program where you design spacecrafts, launch them and complete space missions. By biggest challenge is to land said spacecraft. This project was sparked upon watching a Youtube video of Kerbal Space Program, where the youtuber landed a rocket using Python à la SpaceX (vertical landing). While I did like his solution. I decided to improve on it.
